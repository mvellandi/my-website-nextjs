                        tasting chocolate? Knowing that the cacao farmers are
                        doing well too. John Scharffenberger discusses in this
                        interview with SLM&apos;s Mario Vellandi, the work that he
                        does with the Gates Foundation in Ghana to improve
                        farming methods, production yield, and quality.
                        Additionally, he talks about the current situation in
                        the marketplace of confectioners and farmers at last
                        working more closely together, how the produced
                        chocolate is largely unknown to children in these
                        countries or not as widely available as one might think,
                        and what he sees as the future issues to be addressed in
                        farming and sustainable development.

                            Greetings Sustainability Aficionados,
                            <br />
                            Springtime is nigh up on us. A ripening time for the
                            seeds we&apos;ve planted. An opportunity for us to drive
                            further in our endeavors; Striving to achieve both
                            the planned and expected, and tackle the challenges
                            that lay before us.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I&apos;d like to abstain this week from cheerfully
                            sharing some of the latest stories from around the
                            web, and take some time to reflect on connectedness
                            and the Power of AND.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We are a community with an affinity toward positive
                            change - whatever form that may take. Be it in
                            sustainability or CSR - In some way through our
                            gifts in observing, re-designing, measuring, or
                            communicating, we aim to make this world better for
                            ourselves and everyone else.

                        <p>
                            Naturally, we cannot learn or accomplish much simply
                            on our own. The path that led us here included some
                            amazing people that have inspired us, and forged our
                            attitude of what We can Be and Do. And the circle is
                            widening thanks to new forms of social networking
                            opportunities, both online and through gatherings
                            like our Sustainable Brands event and professional
                            meetups.

                            At large, it&apos;s about connecting organizations
                            together into collaborative partnerships for change.
                            Sustainable and Resilient Change. That which
                            addresses potential improvements in our products,
                            services, processes, management, and organizational
                            culture. That which results in enhanced brand value,
                            business profitability, and social & environmental
                            prosperity.

                            That is the Power of AND
                            <br />
                            That is the promise of applied Systems Thinking
                            <br />
                            The only way we can excel forward - faster...
                            <br />
                            Because we recognize that change comes from within
                            and without
